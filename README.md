### **Project Title**  
**"MarketPulse: Sentiment-Driven Market Movement Predictor Using Transformers"**

---

### **Objective**  
Develop a machine learning pipeline to analyze financial news articles, tweets, and Reddit discussions using Transformer-based models (like BERT, FinBERT, or GPT) to predict market sentiment and its correlation with stock price movements.

---

### **Project Features**  
1. **Data Collection**:
   - **Sources**: 
     - Financial news websites (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters).
     - Social media platforms (e.g., Twitter API).
     - Financial forums (e.g., Reddit's r/stocks, r/investing).
   - Use web scraping or APIs (e.g., Tweepy for Twitter or PRAW for Reddit) to collect relevant data.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Text Cleaning**:
     - Remove stop words, special characters, and financial jargon.
   - **Tokenization**:
     - Use BERT tokenizer or custom tokenization for financial text.
   - Handle noise like slang and abbreviations in social media text.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Use a **pre-trained Transformer-based model**:
     - **FinBERT** for financial context.
     - Fine-tune BERT or GPT for sentiment classification specific to financial markets.
   - Sentiment classes: **Positive, Negative, Neutral**.

4. **Market Sentiment Scoring**:
   - Aggregate sentiment scores for a specific stock or sector from multiple sources.
   - Combine sentiments from news, tweets, and discussions to compute a **weighted sentiment score**.

5. **Correlation with Stock Movements**:
   - Use historical price data (from sources like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage API).
   - Analyze the relationship between aggregated sentiment scores and stock price movements.

6. **Prediction Model**:
   - Combine sentiment analysis with financial metrics (e.g., moving averages, RSI) using an ensemble of ML models like:
     - Transformers for sentiment embedding.
     - Gradient Boosting or LSTMs for stock price prediction.

7. **Dashboard/Visualization**:
   - Build a real-time dashboard to display:
     - Sentiment trends by company or sector.
     - Predicted stock price movements based on sentiment.
     - Heatmaps of sentiment vs. price correlation.

### **Technical Stack**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - **Transformers**: Hugging Face (BERT, FinBERT, GPT)
  - **NLP**: SpaCy, NLTK
  - **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit/Dash for dashboards
  - **APIs**: Tweepy (Twitter), Alpha Vantage/Yahoo Finance, PRAW (Reddit)

---

### **Key Outcomes**  
- Real-time sentiment analysis on financial discussions and news.
- Improved market prediction accuracy by leveraging transformer embeddings.
- Insights into the influence of public sentiment on stock market movements.

---

### **Advanced Scope**  
1. **Event Detection**:
   - Identify major financial events from sentiment spikes.
   - Correlate events with stock performance for portfolio management.

2. **Cross-Market Analysis**:
   - Compare sentiment trends across markets (e.g., U.S. vs. European markets).
   - Predict sectoral performance based on sentiment divergence.

3. **Generative Models**:
   - Use GPT-like models to simulate potential market scenarios based on sentiment trends.
